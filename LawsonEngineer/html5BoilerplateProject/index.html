                            </h2>
                            <p>
                                I am a computer engineer, living and working in Louisville, KY.  I spend a great deal of time coding
                                and on computers.  I am constantly looking for a new project to try out and a reason to use the
                                hotest new dev stack/tool/fancy button.  I currently work for a local company (~500 employees,
                                ~100 engineers total, ~20 engineers on my team) that focuses on health care and insurance.  I am
                                responsible for leading a team of engineers, working on a large system running millions of transactions
                                a day.  I love it, high performance code, well designed system architectures, sql tuning, all of it.
                                It makes me want to get up in the morning and work through the night.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I am also very passionate about system design/achitecture and best practices and standards.  Books like
                                Pragmatic Programmer, Software Craftsman, etc resonate with me very deeply.  I want to ensure that
                                I produce quality code, for a system that is as good as I can make it at the time, and I want to
                                continually grow so that the next design I make or contribute on will be better than the last.
                                With that, I also enjoy mentoring and consider it an obligation of more experience engineers to
                                not only pass on lessons learned, but to help demonstrate the best ways of approcaching problems,
                                crafting code, and making something meaningful that will last.
                            </p>

                                I am currently teaching as an adjunct professor at a local technical college. I have also particpated
                                in a local code bootcamp that offers free training to qualified applicants to expose them to entire
                                tech stacks to prepare them for junior level work in the develoment field.

                                I try to keep a blog about random thoughts and some of the projects that I work on.  I also have
                                a consulting site up that has some general information about the type of work that I am available
                                to do.  On the left, I have links to the major sites, github, linkedIn, etc (more to come).  Feel
                                free to reach out to me on any of those sites, ask questions, give feedback, anything at all.

                            <h2>Lawson.Engineer</h2>

                            <p><a href="https://github.com/ccrngd1/lawsonSite">This very site.</a>  Now it probably seems a bit excessive to have a simple site hosted in github.
                            But, my ultimate plan is to remake this site (plus or minus some appropriate features) in several
                            different stacks.  My next planned adventure will be in angular, so check back in for that.</p>

                            <h2>LawsonCS.com</h2>
                            <p><a href="https://lawsoncs.com">A sister site!</a>
                                No source code or cool things to share, but LawsonCS is a consulting business that I run on the side.  </p>

                            <h2>Blog.LawsonCS.com</h2>
                            <p><a href="http://blog.lawsoncs.com">My Blog site!</a>
                                Ok, it's just a wordpress site, but still.  I am going to blog lots of stuff there, all interesting.  Please, visit me, read my ramblings, share my stories, encourage me to do more and better things!</p>

                            <h2>C# Rules Engine</h2>
                            <p><a href="https://github.com/ccrngd1/CSharpRulesEngine">//ToDo: Insert catchy project name here</a>(like RulesRuler, ok no that's dumb).  A too be named project whose purpose is clear:
                            be an extensible, c# based, enterprise level rules engine.  The idea here is I want to be able to author rules, in C#, and have them dynamically loaded into a library.  Once loaded, they will be evaluated as
                            to whether or not the rule is needed to run, and executed if it is needed.  It can accept/return any data type, so other than making binary decision (if/else decision tree style) you can also
                            incorporate data manipulation based on some business logic that you expect to change often.</p>

                            <h2>FileTeligence</h2>
                            <p><a href="https://github.com/ccrngd1/FileTelligence">Intelligent document searching</a>
                                I have a large corpus of pdf/epub files across every tech topic known to man.  I constantly wonder, which of these would cover
                                this topic?  So, I wrote a small TF/IDF categorization tool to help me search a pre-indexed document corpus and return similar/same
                                files to a search query or supplied file</p>

                            <h2>Typed X12Parser</h2>
                            <p><a href="https://github.com/ccrngd1/x12Parser">My very own, fancy X12 parser.</a>
                                Once upon a time, I worked for a company that dealt with healthcare, specifically healthcare data and the X12 EDI format.
                            They had their own proprietary X12 parsers (a few of them) and I was un-impressed with all of them. X12 document format being
                            a highly defined domain specific language, it seemed ripe for a computer professional such as myself to make a better version.
                            Unlike several of the others I have seen, this relies on a single definition for each individual segment, and a c# definition of each
                            file type you want to parse.  Once they are defined, the parser populates a POCO representation of the file with various options
                            for validation and standard enforcement.  While each segment field is stored as a string, there are extensions for accessing the data
                            as the correct type as well.</p>

                            <h2>Custom Log Library</h2>
                            <p><a href="https://github.com/ccrngd1/LoggingLibrary">LoggingLibrary</a> (I spent a long time naming that one).  As I have worked
                            at several companies, the way in which errors are handled are always a point of contention.  When I ran up against it recently, I
                            endeavored to create my own custom solution that would work for many different use cases, out of the box.</p>
                            <p>It is built around the idea of Log4Net and has a high degree of interoperability, in fact, it can be used as a drop in replacement.
                            It also supports ideas like Windows Event Logger and Performance Counters, a custom build SQL warehousing option, Splunk, and email.
                            It alleviates the need for logging multiple different ways depending on the type or severity of the error, and exposes simply yet powerful
                            API to solve all your logging needs.  Plus, being extensible means you can log to the new hotness in just a few short lines of code!</p>

                            <h2>Sullivan University Courses</h2>
                            <p><a href="https://github.com/ccrngd1/SCTD-DWD273-CSharp">Intro to C#</a></p>
                            <p><a href="https://github.com/ccrngd1/SCTD-DWD278-MVC5">Intro to MVC5 with C#</a></p>

                            <p>During my time at Sullivan University, I post all of my class notes, slides, homework, etc on GitHub so they are available
                            not only to my current students, but to anyone who is interested in the material.  It is a hope that I will be able to craft more
                            online content/instructional material for each course so they become a standalone resource for anyone to use (including recorded lectures,
                            and hosted quizzes/exams/hosted homework grading).</p>

                            <h2>Programming Katas (esp Project Euler)</h2>
                            <p><a href="https://github.com/ccrngd1/projectEuler">I am a big fan of Code Katas!</a>  I think are a ton of fun and can really help
                            give you a reason to try a new language, a new design patter, a new toy, or just hammer away at your coding skills!  This is a collection of
                            various problems that I have solved in this arena.  I often use these as a basis for code prompts for my students, and when I find new ones,
                            I always take the time to implement the solutions myself, right here.  It is a great place to explore some cool and fun code, and many
                            of the solutions are also documented over on <a href="http://blow.lawsoncs.com">my blog!</a></p>
