                            <p>
                                I am a computer engineer, living and working in Louisville, KY.  I spend a great deal of time coding
                                and on computers.  I am constantly looking for a new project to try out and a reason to use the
                                hotest new dev stack/tool/fancy button.  I currently work for a local company (~500 employees,
                                ~100 engineers total, ~20 engineers on my team) that focuses on health care and insurance.  I am
                                responsible for leading a team of engineers, working on a large system running millions of transactions
                                a day.  I love it, high performance code, well designed system architectures, sql tuning, all of it.
                                It makes me want to get up in the morning and work through the night.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I am also very passionate about system design/achitecture and best practices and standards.  Books like
                                Pragmatic Programmer, Software Craftsman, etc resonate with me very deeply.  I want to ensure that
                                I produce quality code, for a system that is as good as I can make it at the time, and I want to
                                continually grow so that the next design I make or contribute on will be better than the last.
                                With that, I also enjoy mentoring and consider it an obligation of more experience engineers to
                                not only pass on lessons learned, but to help demonstrate the best ways of approcaching problems,
                                crafting code, and making something meaningful that will last.

                                I am currently teaching as an adjunct professor at a local technical college. I have also particpated
                                in a local code bootcamp that offers free training to qualified applicants to expose them to entire
                                tech stacks to prepare them for junior level work in the develoment field.

                                I try to keep a blog about random thoughts and some of the projects that I work on.  I also have
                                a consulting site up that has some general information about the type of work that I am available
                                to do.  On the left, I have links to the major sites, github, linkedIn, etc (more to come).  Feel
                                free to reach out to me on any of those sites, ask questions, give feedback, anything at all.

                            But, my ulitmate plan is to remake this site (plus or minus some appropriae features) in several
                            different stacks.  My next planned adventure will be in angular, so check back in for that.</p>
